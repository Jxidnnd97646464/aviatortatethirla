## What is Aviator?

Aviator is a simple but exciting casino game. The goal of the game is to
cash out your bet before the plane flies away. The plane takes off and
flies higher and higher, and the multiplier increases as it flies. You
can cash out at any time, but if you wait too long, the plane will fly
away and you\'ll lose your bet.

have created an account, you can deposit money into your account and

start flying. You can cash out at any time by clicking the "cash
out" button.
